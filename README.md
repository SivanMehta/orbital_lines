# Orbital Lines

### Why did you make this?
Inspired by [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/comments/3dpp3l/8_earth_years_are_roughly_equal_to_13_venus_years/) /r/woahdude post, I just wanted to see if I could reproduce the same results.

This particular instance has Earth and Venus orbiting a body with a very loose approximation of their orbits. For 13 venus years, there are 8 earth years, so the animation has been speed up so you can see the entirety of the generation in ~45 seconds, rather than 104 years.

I have also included a .png file in case you don't want to run the whole thing. I whipped this together in about an hour, so I just used python2 to write it
```
[~] python --version
Python 2.7.8
```
### How do I run this?
Running this file is just a matter of executing the script.
```
[~] python orbit.py
Done after 44.74 seconds!
```
### What does the final product look like?
